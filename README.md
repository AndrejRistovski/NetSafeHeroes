# NetSafe Heroes 🛡️
A small educational 2D platformer made in **Godot 4** that teaches real-world cybersecurity basics through gameplay + short quiz challenges.

## What it is
Each level represents a different cyber threat (adware, phishing, spyware, trojans, ransomware). The player clears the level, then answers a quick multiple-choice question to reinforce a real-life safety habit.

## Core Educational Mechanic (Quiz → Lives)
After finishing a level, a **Question Panel** appears:
- ✅ Correct answer: **+1 life**
- ❌ Wrong answer: **-1 life**

This makes learning affect progression, not just story text.
